## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-----------------|------|------|:-----:|
| clan\_name | The name of the clan | `string` | n/a | yes |
| clan\_project\_id | Clan Project ID | `string` | n/a | yes |
| cloudfunction\_monitoring | If the Cloud Function dashboards and alerts should be created | `bool` | `false` | no |
| cloudrun\_monitoring | If the Cloud Run dashboards and alerts should be created | `bool` | `false` | no |
| cloudsql\_monitoring | If the Cloud SQL dashboards and alerts should be created | `bool` | `false` | no |
| dataflow\_monitoring | If the Dataflow dashboards and alerts should be created | `bool` | `false` | no |
| dlq\_count\_alignment\_period | The alignment period for per-time series alignment. If present, alignmentPeriod must be at least 60 seconds. After per-time series alignment, each time series will contain data points only on the period boundaries. If perSeriesAligner is not specified or equals ALIGN_NONE, then this field is ignored. If perSeriesAligner is specified and does not equal ALIGN_NONE, then this field must be defined; otherwise an error is returned. | `string` | `"60s"` | no |
| dlq\_count\_comparison | The comparison to apply between the time series (indicated by filter and aggregation) and the threshold (indicated by threshold_value). The comparison is applied on each time series, with the time series on the left-hand side and the threshold on the right-hand side. Only COMPARISON_LT and COMPARISON_GT are supported currently. | `string` | `"COMPARISON_GT"` | no |
| dlq\_count\_duration | The amount of time that a time series must violate the threshold to be considered failing.

When choosing a duration, it is useful to keep in mind the frequency of the underlying time series data (which may also be affected by any alignments specified in the aggregations field); a good duration is long enough so that a single outlier does not generate spurious alerts, but short enough that unhealthy states are detected and alerted on quickly. | `string` | `"60s"` | no |
